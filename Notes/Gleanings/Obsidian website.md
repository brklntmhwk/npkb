[Obsidian - Sharpen your thinking](https://obsidian.md/)
## Memo
### Your thoughts are yours.
> Obsidian stores notes on your device, so you can access them quickly, even offline. No one else can read them, not even us.

### Your mind is unique.
> With [hundreds of plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) and themes, you can shape Obsidian to fit your way of thinking.

### Your knowledge should last.
> Obsidian uses open, non-proprietary files, so you're never locked in, and can preserve your data for the long term.
