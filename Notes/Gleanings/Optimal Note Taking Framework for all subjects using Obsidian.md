- This video is all about a comprehensive note-taking workflow using Obsidian
- A summary from ChatGPT: [[Obsidian NoteTaking Framework]]
### Transcript:
(00:02) in a world where most people still take notes by hand where most note-taking naps are terrible or expensive paralyzed by possibilities how do we choose unlike most hard choices in life this is easy and here we go
(01:08) hello everyone my name is bradyang and in this video i'll talk about my entire workflow of taking notes using obsidian the md handwriting and other supplementary applications so that after this video you will also be equipped with this overpowered technique that will truly separate you from the pack so don't tell any of your arch enemies of this video because true power should be on the hands of the few let's get started we first briefly talked about why why exactly should we use obsidian instead of other
(01:35) note-taking applications or just plain handwriting the handwriting one is easy to explain because in fact i regularly use ipad to do math homeworks or draw diagrams sometimes they even use pen and paper because some old school professor still requires handwritten homeworks or cheat sheets we're not trying to get rid of handwriting we're super powering it by making it searchable or making it more concise and readable using the power obsidian and other tools that i will talk about shortly then what's so
(02:00) special about obsidian three key points first point is local unlike obsidian that stores everything in your own local file the other main contestants like notion or room research host all your files in their own online database this creates problems because your notes are not future proof in a sense those companies basically owns all your private files and they can charge you monthly fees in the future if they really want to and many already do in comparison obsidian is completely free and local and you can even back up
(02:29) all your files and github every minute if you want keeping a version control system so that you never lose anything another problem to non-local files is a lag obsidian can access all your files instantaneously because they're all in your hard drive but for non-local apps like notion the lag will be more and more frustrating as your notebook grows because your computer needs to connect to a distant database to search and fetch your notes of course you'll be slow second point is freedom obsidian's
(02:55) central philosophy is to let you the user decide how to use the app while still providing immensely powerful tools in every direction you can but don't have to follow a strictly photo like architecture such as onenote or evernote you can but don't have to create an unstructured node based system where you build associations such as rom research or ram note you also get to choose what style and theme you want to go for what stack of tools to use which brings us to the third point community obsidians like
(03:21) the vs code for note taking where there are tens of thousands of individual teams of developers pouring their heart out into incredibly useful features like spaced repetition that is on par with anki syncing between laptop and mobile devices advanced tables calendar drawing mind map to-do list you can't even run code in here by this point you can basically leave your life with just one app soon we'll replace doodle doc 2 with the collaborative feature in the next release if you know a thing or two about
(03:49) coding you can make your own plugin in this touring complete app and the official dev team is making so much progress the app has improved so much during my mere nine months of using it that it basically went from knack to red dead redemption 2. i know that switching a note-taking system can be intimidating at first but it will be so incredibly worthy in the long run that i recommend you to at least try it out one of my biggest regrets is not trying it sooner because getting bees is really a thing of the past let's finally begin with the
(04:16) setup guide if you already have obsidian and i have set it up please skip to here this tutorial is cheryl and mori approved alrighty your favorite browser search obsidian click on the first link and get obsidian for mac os or whatever your system is and wait for it to download after the download finishes let's open it up click on here and drag and let's open it up search obsidian your icon will be different than mine i'll teach you how to switch it later here's the first interface this will be your list of vaults vaults
(04:57) is obsidian's term for a big folder see folder as vault all right let's create our first vault and name it whatever you want might be brad's vault and location let's put it on desktop or anywhere you want create all right and here is our new vault first i will enlarge text so that you guys can see it better and click on the expand to see other tools and on the left click setting appearance and we can choose a theme here usually i use the light but after [Music] actually this tutorial i really like the groov box because
(05:43) previously i wasn't experimenting with the themes but now look at this beautiful light but for this tutorial i'll use the dark version of this because we'll do some space based themes um for getting used to obsidian so you know the dark space background is perfect in this environment all right let's create our first note by pressing command n or pressing this new note button here and let's replace this title by interstellar travel because space is cool and let's type some description here the idea of
(06:19) interstellar probes or crude spacecraft moving between stars or planetary systems in a galaxy for example the potential traveling from the solar system to alpha centauri okay now you wonder what is an alpha centauri and here's the magical moment where outgoing links can be immensely helpful one of the key features in obsidian let's select it and let's press bracket twice it will automatically enclose it and then let's click on this here we create we just created a new note called alpha centauri directly from here so from now on if you
(06:59) click on this again you'll be instantly transferred to here and as you can see you know there's a backlinks to um where the alpha center is linked back and let's add some description here a gravitationally bound system of the closest three stars and their exoplanets to our solar system most notably proxima centauri b maybe you are wondering what is the exoplanet so let's add a description explanation mark and then double brackets exoplanets exoplanet is not created yet click to create click all right here we created another node
(07:42) and let's add some description an exoplanet is any planet beyond our solar system all right let's go back to alpha centauri and look there's this description here um so what we did is we added an explanation mark between the brackets and now this displays the notes directly as the old saying goes a picture is worth a thousand words so let's add a picture so i found a picture here and it's very easy just drag it and there we go now a beautiful picture let's um actually add a space here there we go so here is a picture of
(08:18) alpha centauri of the two stars and the third circled in red maybe you're wondering what is proxima centauri be and you know the drill now just select it double brackets click elsewhere and click again to create a new node and here we display the parallel links instead of typing an exoplanet and then do this instead we can just n double bracket exoplanet we don't even have to type the full thing we just type yeah ex and it searches the possible files and boom done and now you can click on here and it goes back to exoplanet
(08:58) let's keep typing and here again we use the link [Music] and now we add a picture so now we showcase how to manage the download files so download and now we can drag then there we go and as you can see this is a jpg file and let's organize this a bit by clicking a folder and let's say astrology well this is obviously not formal astrology but we'll make do so let's drag all the astrology files in and let's drag the image bank photo in now say we want to create a new node called time dilation in astrology folder
(09:58) um let's create it oops why is it outside of astrology um to fix this let's click settings file and links uh and default location for new nodes same folder as current file in my opinion it is the most intuitive so let's do that and let's delete this by delete and are you sure you want to delete this yes and don't ask again i prefer that um now let's click let's say we are in here and new note boom easy and let's name it time dilation bingo now that we have a few notes let's click
(10:39) on the graph view open graph view and we have the graph there are all sorts of things that you can do i created a video by clicking on this this showcases the history of all the notes as you can see actual planets is linked to proxima centauri and time deletion is alone and you can very smoothly move these around which i think is pretty cool oh by the way this is actually the overall graph view so let's open the local graph view let's move it out of the way click on random notes and command p to open the command palette
(11:16) if your command p doesn't work uh go to settings hotkeys command palette and then you can change the hotkey here for example command k or something about this already have some haki so i will leave it as that command p and then local graph view so select by pressing up or down arrow local graph here's the local graph so we currently are in the interstellar travel so the local graph has only one let's drag this down here this is my default configuration we have achieved the default very nice click on this
(12:02) there we go very beautiful so here is the overall graph view this is the local graph view i just want to give a small remark about the graph view because i know it's very very rewarding and interesting to change all everything about the graph view um you can change you know color it based on tags groups and forces you can change so much stuff about the graph view but in my experience it's not really worth it because after you get like hundreds and thousands of notes in your vault um you can't really see anything
(12:42) in my actual vault i have like probably less than a thousand notes but it's actually already so cluttered um it's still very very pretty like you can make it very pretty but don't try to optimize your note based on the graph view um for example you can if some links makes it not aesthetically pleasing please don't um you know refrain from doing so just because the graph view doesn't look pretty as your vault grows the local graph view is actually be much more important than the overall graph view because it gives
(13:18) you actual information about the note for example proximate centauri b is linked to this and you can even click on this to go to the note which is very cool one quick tip if you want to use this photo like structure for all your notes i recommend to click on change sort order button and change from sorting by file name a to z to change time to created time altenew in this way you can have your earliest notes on the top and then your newest note on the bottom i think it's very useful another quick tip you can click on
(13:55) command option left to go to the previous note or right to go to the next note and you can click on multiple to see your entire history if you use a mouse and keyboard and your keyboard have these like left or right key or left and right scroll key i recommend you to map these key to the left and right shifting key because in my opinion it will save you a lot of time to move from mouse to keyboard and press the button and so on beyond the photo like structure we can also create tags using hashtag and the text for example
(14:31) math or history and so on and so forth and these tags are useful because you can click on them and see all of that and they'll also be very useful in the end key plugin that we'll talk about in a second you can also very easily create unordered list by pressing minus space alpha and enter beta gamma and so on and so forth you can also create order list by pressing one dot space alpha beta gamma there we go you can add a horizontal separator by pressing underscore underscore underscore three times you can add inline latex
(15:10) environment within double dollar sign and you can add multi-line environment within quadruple dollar time let's now discuss the various search functions the obsidian offers us the first one is command o or title search in this search you only search the titles see here there's only five of them for example interstellar travel and you will search for that or exoplanet and it will search for that good then there's a search within the file by pressing command f for example planet and it will highlight
(15:43) the planet right here and the third one is search everything by pressing shift command f and for example 4.2 and boom and this is highlighted perfect and there's a fourth one that we'll talk about right now in this section let's talk about the obsidian plugins that i use the most in note-taking the first one is an advanced search trust me this will be the most important plugin you have let's go to settings community plugin turn on community plugin browse let's type in quick switcher plus plus
(16:18) this is the plugin for the advanced search let's install and enable let's go and now let's go to settings hotkeys quick switcher let's click on the open in headings mode and make this command l i think this command l is really probably the best because usually you press command o for the title search but this is more advanced search that also searches headings in case you don't know obsidian files are all markdown so you can create like headings one two three um the more hashtag you add in the smaller normally you wouldn't be
(17:06) able to search the headings for example you command o one two three and this will create a new note um because the normal search is only for headings but here you you can press command l and one two three it shows and it will highlight it and this is very important because instead of having to create notes such as proxy messenger a and proximate temperature b and c we can refactor all of this in alpha centauri so one note four layers so let's delete these notes and i'll show you how i normally do this so
(17:45) here's how i usually structure my notes um if there's some you know some stuff that are not extraordinarily important or something that doesn't take too much space because if it takes too much space in a note is usually clutter it um but one good thing about it is you can just close it you can close all of these um right for example let's now search for it proxima centauri a boom there it is you can open it voila you can enter your inline code block within two backticks and you can enter multiline code block
(18:26) within three backticks and specifying the language c plus plus and there we go and you can stylize it better with command e or a reading mode this is the current view the default is editing mode where you can type stuff um but in reading mode you cannot do anything if your keyboard shortcut is different you can search it here the second most important plugin is space repetition let's find it by going to community plugins browse um spaced repetition and install and i go here we go let's now first configure the space
(19:13) repetition by scrolling all the way down to community plug-in space repetition first let's add a folder to ignore and that will be image bank you can add multiple because we don't want to review the jpegs and then the tag for flashcards will be hashtag flash cards so basically if you want the flashcard functionality you just add the tag in and it will just work and keep scrolling to separator for inline flash cards uh it'll be double colon and all of these will be a reference so if you're a seasoned
(19:53) c plus plus veteran this will not take effect in uh the code blocks so don't worry about that and uh tax to review make sure it's hashtag review we already added a tag of hashtag review and they'll come in handy so make sure to switch on open a random note for review it doesn't work without it and open next note automatically after review and also this these two work together and uh laters you can configure the algorithm if you want to you know the base ease all the anki review steps by the way if open next node
(20:34) automatically after review is not working properly just click on these two a few times and change some configurations it will work out i think there's a minor bug somewhere all right let's first add some hotkeys for the plugin because otherwise it will be pretty hard to use so open a node for review let's set this to command option h or any shortcut really that you find convenient on review note is easy good hard as command option j command option k command option l and also this one view statistics this
(21:08) would be pretty cool um to see statistics um command option p all right let's first open a random note for review by pressing command option h um so there are two main features of this plugin the first one is you look at the title name and you see um if you recognize it for example exoplanet what is the exoplanet uh it is any planet beyond our solar system so if you believe that you get it then press good in my case command option k and you set it up all right let's open another random note alpha centauri
(21:49) i think i forgot about that so i'll click on forgot and you see that this will be different the interval is one day and you'll get the same one tomorrow um all right let's open another one and uh time dilation that's different but uh okay excellent okay and there we go you're all done for today if it stopped um changing it means you're done all right let's now explore the power of flashcards make sure you spell it correctly it's flash cards for example if you want to remember earth you can ask yourself what
(22:32) is our planet called and you add these two columns you can change these um if you really want to in the settings um but i'll keep it for now and earth there we go and let's add another one who are the cutest cats on earth and it will be cheryl and maury there we go oh there she is right now let's click on flash card here and click on flash cards what is our planet called earth yeah earth and say good who are the cutest cats on earth cheryl and murray never forget that easy all right there we go and if you still
(23:22) prefer to use anki um you can go to community plugins browse and anki obsidian to anki you can install this and explore it yourself another plugin that i regularly use is advanced tables on community plug-in browse advanced tables very popular as you can see um right let's install and enable all right using this plugin is very simple just press vertical bar and then type it in cat name um color personality all right there we go um and uh i'll type some stuff in cheryl um black and white personality queen obviously
(24:18) whoever objects deserves to die more yellow and playful there we go that's it so we just created a table um depending on your plugin depending on your theme it will look differently but this is how it looks and this is how it looks in the reading mode pretty good oh by the way bolding is command b this bolds the text um and highlighting is actually not command h so i recommend you to go to setting highlight 2b command h this will makes it highlighting and what if you say oh this is very ugly i don't want this color
(25:08) well very easy community plug-in highlight um highlighter install enable all right now we can highlight with different colors let's go it'll look very differently in different themes but it'll be pretty cool regardless orange or the classic yellow they're all in sort of coding html code but they will all show perfectly all right lastly we'll talk about annotator just go to community plugin and and install enable all right let's add a random pdf for example there it is this is the pdf without the annotation it's still
(26:08) scrollable but you cannot annotate easily all right let's create a new note here called mst annotation or anything any title you want let's create a code block annotation target column and then specify the pdf pdf all right there we go and then open the command palette and the annotator toggle annotation and markdown mode boom there we go we open the pdf right now [Music] and we can annotate freely for example annotate this is the greatest theorem alive all right there you go post only me you can you know sign up and log in if you
(27:00) want but this is working properly you know the plugins truly are the power of obsidian there are so many plugins to choose from oh my god they're all developed by like independent developers so props to them i will never be able to cover all of them but here are the ones that i recommend you to check out dataview mind map kanban board dictionary calendar admonition and sync good luck finally let's talk about the external applications that i can't live without the first one is fly cut this one is very simple it just helps you remember
(27:35) what you copied for example you know copy and you copy another one and then you can open an interface to select the things that you were typing and there we go you can type multiple things and you will never have problems remembering what you typed the second one is on clutter it basically just unclutters your desktop you don't have to drag like this to access your desktop you just click a button like this and then you have access to some files that you can you know put here for example my obsidian folder you can
(28:11) drag or whatever you want to do the third one is text expander oops typo um so you can really type much faster with this for example instead of typing this i set as keyboard shortcut for this you can if you're working with attack you can very easily like do something like this do something like that do something like this do something like integer you know you can do a lot of things you can set all of that and it's very cool and finally mathpix is a very powerful attack tool where you just take a attack image
(28:50) and then you just copy and paste it it's really simple all right welcome to my actual vault this is actually the note where i planned everything in this video is extremely disorganized but it gets the job done yeah imagine doing an obsidian video inside obsidian that's pretty crazy and look at this graph can you really see anything honestly i can't uh obviously you can zoom in and out but in my opinion this is much more useful um but still this is very extraordinarily un cluttered because i you know linked
(29:26) all of these uh or i plan to use all these notes but i didn't really all right so i really want to show you guys three key examples of how i take notes utilizing everything that we just learned the first one will be um no handwriting and a little bit of coding all right let's go to vector c plus plus there we go so this uh if we push command e will be in the reading mode so this is one of a key example of how i do you know programming notes um you know this is a c plus plus so that the highlighting gets done very
(30:09) well and uh you know vector and c plus plus and you have a short description and then you have some example code all right all of these um have like these underscores i think they're very important for keeping it very organized um like this you know pretty aesthetically pleasing in my opinion um and all of these are anki notes and in my opinion they are very helpful obviously it's not recommended to [Music] remember everything because programming i mean you're not supposed to remember everything or you know humans cannot
(30:52) do that um but for an exam we sort of have to do that and um i just sort of have to remember all of the functions and that's how i do this the second example is how i structured the majority of my notes let's go to pnp the following are all decision problems this is a reference note to remind me of what is a decision problem very nice and here the layout should be quite familiar to you so the headers and the descriptions or explanations pnp blah blah blah and as you can see this is ordered based on the titles we
(31:31) have all of these supporting documents for and be hard and here is a handwriting from ipad and here is a screenshot from a textbook and here's the diagram very nice so these bullet points are quite powerful because if you click on them and they expand or they shrink just like that this helps me organize this note better you can also do a mini anki by having the question and solution in different sort of configurations and this is a quite elaborate solution very nice and yeah this is basically just how i organize these with some
(32:22) triple underscore dividers this will look this will look very clean the third example is how i structure completely handwritten notes for example l ud composition so this is a worksheet that one of my professors gave me in linear algebra so this is a worksheet with some ipad stuff i did all these in ipad or but these obviously applies to handwritten stuff as well you just take some pictures and then you import it here so after you import as images not pdfs because pdfs cannot have like these powerful search functions you just add
(33:02) these titles for example if you want to um if you're wondering what is the elementary matrix when scrolling elsewhere or even in different notes elementary matrix boom go straight here you just guide you towards this exact note so that you don't have to sift through so many notes to get to where you want and this applies to all of these um you know they're very powerful this is what i was talking about super powering your handwritten notes if you want to change the display image for your obsidian go to finder and
(33:41) search obsidian locate the obsidian and right click get info and then you have this window open so i have a lot of them but let's say you want this one so you just drag onto this icon you'll see a plus sign and boom there we go and all you need to do is to quit it and reopen it and you're all set this video takes more than 100 hours to make and i'm dedicated to all of you amazing people who have studied with me on stream i never thought i deserved this and i didn't know how to repay all of you so i tried to make this video as
(34:18) perfect as possible despite the pain from the 1 billion problems it ran into and the 1 trillion retakes love you all and i see you tomorrow if you've made it here you're an absolute champion hopefully this video has been useful to you if you have any lingering questions comments or if you have any procrastination issues you can check out my study with me stream here where we try to make studying as fun as possible and i'll see you in the next video goodbye
